# -*- mode: Makefile -*-
# This system dependent makefile configures the following variables:
#    dllpref        The prefix for dynamic/shared libraries. This is 'lib'
#                   on most systems.
#    dllsuff        The suffix for dynamic/shared libraries. This is '.so'
#                   on most systems.
#    DLLFLAGS       Linker flags that are required when building shared
#                   libaries.
#    RDYNAMIC       Flags that are required when creating a binary that
#                   supports runtime linking.
#    MPIROOT        Root directory of MPI installation.
#    MPILIBDIR      Directory where MPI libraries are, usually $(MPIROOT)/lib.
#    MPILIB         The MPI libraries, usually 'mpi'.
#    MPIINCDIR      The directory for MPI headers, usually $(MPIROOT)/include.
#    MPIRUN         The mpirun binary, usually $(MPIROOT)/bin/mpirun.
#    LDLIBPATH      The name of the environment variable that is used by the
#                   runtime linker to discover library paths. On most
#                   platforms this is LD_LIBRARY_PATH, on Mac it is
#                   DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
#    O              The suffix for object files (.obj on Windows, .o else)
#    E              The suffix for executable files (.exe on Windows,
#                   empty on other platforms)
#    REMOTEJAVA     Runs a JVM that has the $(TRANSPORT) directory on the
#                   classpath
#    REMOTE-CPPUFUN-LNFLAGS  Special linker flags that are required when
#                   a remote object user function is linked with C++.
